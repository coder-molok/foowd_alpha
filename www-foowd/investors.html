                <h3>foowd - what we do</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>foowd </strong>is a fair
                    marketplace where producers can directly sell their own products, and a
                    logistics integrated solutions to grant efficiency and sustainability. 
                    <strong>foowd</strong>
                    applies a win-win strategy that reconnects and aggregates offer and 
                    demand on the same platform, merging producers and consumers needs: this
                    is possibile thanks to innovative social engineered solutions that we 
                    called: "<em>crowd-sourcing of distribution</em>".
                    This is a disrupting way to decrease logistics cost without charging on
                    the final price. Also, interaction among customers is lived as an 
                    exciting and new experience, generating an conspicuous value throught 
                    the supply chain.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>
                    Our revenue model consists in a subscription paid by 
                    sellers to have access to the aggregated demand and online visibility, 
                    to allow best and more performative producers to use at best their 
                    advantage. No fees are applied on the final price and there are no costs
                    to place insertions. We offer to consumers a <em>free service</em>.
                    Differently than traditional online marketplaces like Ebay, our revenue
                    model makes the practice of free riding harmless, because we do not 
                    have any share of selling price. <strong>foowd </strong>also&nbsp;provides
                    to consumers a browser integration that allows our brand new purchasing
                    experience on any other site. We use tools of web 2.0 to make the 
                    social sharing a disrupting way to buy things.

                    Market desires quality products at a fair price. 
                    There’s a lack of distribution of quality food, and an asymmetry between
                    huge demand of such goods and the limited offer that follows. 
                    <strong>foowd</strong>
                    aims to solve the main problems of the market pursuing social 
                    cooperation and a win-win strategy for all parts involved, from farmers 
                    to final consumers.

                <p>
                    <strong>foowd</strong> is a startup with solid bases and contact 
                    already started with agricultural association in Italy. 
                    The actual stage is a studio-sized company, the final solution 
                    and the scale-up should come in about ten months.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our first closed beta platform is already available in Italian, 
                    and we are completing the fine tuning for user experience, 
                    behavioural marketing and investor relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A solid marketing strategy and the opportunity offered by Expo 2015, 
                    focused on agriculture, will allow growth of the company 
                    before end of the third year.

                <p>
                    <strong>foowd </strong>has still some available position for investor: 
                    it requires a limited amount of initial investment to reach break-even 
                    in the second year of operation, allowing a very fast exiting strategy 
                    from investment in the 3° year with around 300% net profit. 
                    The break-even requires only about 1.000 paying users and will 
                    be touched during the second year.
